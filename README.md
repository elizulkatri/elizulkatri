### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Eli Zulkatri
I believe that data tells us more than just numbers, it helps us understand our users and their desires. So that's why I really enjoy learning data analysis and data science. I have 2 years of experience in data analytics since I started my master's degree (2020) from the Institute of Technology Bandung with an actuarial science specialization. Now I am working in product management in Shopee Indonesia but I am still hoping that I can work as a data analyst. Just give me a chance, and I will prove that I can be your data analyst. I am now skilled in SQL, Excel, Python, and Power BI/Tableau.  

## Skills and Experience
1. Excel
2. SQL
3. Python
4. Power BI and Tableau
