I believe that data tells us more than just numbers, it helps us understand our users and their desires. So that's why I really enjoy learning data analysis and data science. I have 2 years of experience in data analytics since I started my master's degree from the Institute of Technology Bandung with an actuarial science specialization. Now I am working in product management in Shopee Indonesia but I am still hoping that I can work as a data analyst. Just give me a chance, and I will prove that I can be your data analyst.
I am now skilled in SQL, Excel, Python, and Power BI/Tableau.  

Skills: Excel / SQL / Python / Power BI / R
