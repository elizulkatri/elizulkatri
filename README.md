### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Eli Zulkatri
I believe that data tells us more than just numbers, it helps us understand our users and their desires. So that's why I enjoy learning data analysis and data science. I have 2 years of experience in data analytics since I started my master's degree (2020) from the Institute of Technology Bandung with an actuarial science specialization. Now I am working in product management in Shopee Indonesia but I am still hoping that I can work as a data analyst.
